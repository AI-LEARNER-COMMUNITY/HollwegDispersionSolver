# HollwegDispersionSolver
This python notebook details the functionality of the hollweg() function. This function computes the wave frequencies for given wavenumbers and plasma parameters based on the solution to the two fluid dispersion relation presented by Hollweg 1999, and further summarized by Bellan 2012.
